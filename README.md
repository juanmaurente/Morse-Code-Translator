# Morse-Code-Translator

## Outline

This task will require you to create a web page Morse Code translator. The User Interface will have to look good but should remain simple (additional features, ie. sounds, lights, etc, should only be added once the MVP has been completed.)

## MVP

Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code

Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

translate their English text into Morse Code
Morse Code into English text
Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

Make sure to separate pure JS functions and DOM manipulation

Add unit testins for each of the pure function that your translator uses (each function should have at least 4 tests, think of edge case, wrong inputs, etc ...)

### Useful Resources:

Iterate Object in JavaScript
Looping through objects keys and values in Javascript?
